Problem : Given a Binary Heap and an element present in the given Heap. The task is to delete an element from this Heap. 


EXPALANATION : 

The standard deletion operation on Heap is to delete the element present at the root node of the Heap. That is if it is a Max Heap, 
the standard deletion operation will delete the maximum element and if it is a Min heap, it will delete the minimum element.

Process of Deletion: 
Since deleting an element at any intermediary position in the heap can be costly, so we can simply replace the element to be deleted
by the last element and delete the last element of the Heap. 

     -> Replace the root or element to be deleted by the last element.
     -> Delete the last element from the Heap.
     ->Since, the last element is now placed at the position of the root node. So, it may not follow the heap property. Therefore, heapify the last node placed at the position of root.



CODE : 

#include<iostream>
using namespace std;


class heap{
    public:

    int arr[1000];
    int size;

    heap(){
        arr[0] = -1;
        size = 0;
    }
    void insert(int val){

        size++;

        int index = size;
        arr[index] = val;

        while(index > 1){
            int parent = index/2;

            if(arr[parent] < arr[index]){
                swap(arr[parent], arr[index]);
                index = parent; 
            }
            else{
                return;
            }
        }
    }

    void print(){
        for(int i = 1 ; i<size;i++){
            cout<<arr[i]<<" ";
        }
        cout<<endl;
    }


    void deletefromHeap(){
        if(size == 0){
            cout<< "nothing to delete "<< endl;
            return;
        }
        arr[1] = arr[size];
        size--;

        //take root node to its correct position
        int i = 1;
        while(i<size){
            int leftIndex = 2*i;
            int rightIndex = 2*i+1;
              
              if(leftIndex < size && arr[i]<arr[leftIndex]){
                swap(arr[i],arr[leftIndex]);
                i = leftIndex;

              }
              else if(rightIndex < size && arr[i] < arr[rightIndex]){
                swap(arr[i],arr[rightIndex]);
                i = rightIndex;

              }
              else{
                return;
              }
        }

    }
};
int main(){

    heap h ; 
    h.insert(50);
    h.insert(55);
    h.insert(53);
    h.insert(52);
    h.insert(54);

    h.print();

    h.deletefromHeap();
    h.print();

    return 0;

}
