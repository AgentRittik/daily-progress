PROBLEM : Given an array 'arr' of integrer numbers . Where 'arr[i]' represents the number of pages in the 'i-th book.
          There are 'm' numbers of students and the task is to allocate all the books to their students . Allocate 
          books in such a way that : 
          
          1. Each student gets atleast one book .
          2. Each book should be allocated to student .
          3.Book allocation should be in contiguous manner.
          
          you have to allocate the book to 'm' students such that the maximum numbers of pages assigned to a student
          is minimum . 
          
          
          
          
          
CODE :

    int count = 1;
    int pageSum = 0;
    for(int i = 0 ; i<n;i++){
        if(pageSum + arr[i] <= mid){      // did the mistake here it will always be pageSum + arr[i] but i was only taking pageSum -> due to this the loop will run for 
                                          // 1 extra time and this will leads to pagesum greater than the actual result 
            pageSum+= arr[i];
        }
        else{
