Problem Statement : 1

you have been given an integer array/list (Arr)of size N . Where N is equal to [2M+1]
now , in the given array/list, 'M' numbers are present twice and one number is present only once .
you need to find and return that number which is unique in the array/list

SOLUTION : - 

int findUnique(int *arr, int size)
{
    //Write your code here
    int ans  = 0;
    for(int i =0 ;i<size;i++){
        ans  = ans^arr[i];
    }
    return ans ;
}

Problem Statement : 2

you have been given an array (Arr) of size N containing each number between 1 and N-1 at least once .
there is a single integer value that is present in the array twice . your task is to find the 
duplicate integer value present in that array .


SOLUTION : 


int findDuplicate(vector<int> &arr) 
{
    // Write your code here
	int ans  = 0;
    for (int i = 0; i<arr.size();i++){
        ans  = ans^arr[i];
    }
    for(int i =1;i<arr.size();i++){
        ans = ans^i;
    }
    return ans;
}
